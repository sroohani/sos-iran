  subject: 'Concern Over Political Executions in Iran',
  body: `
Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to express my deep concern regarding the ongoing executions and systematic human rights violations carried out by the Islamic Republic of Iran.

I would like to begin by sincerely acknowledging the European Union’s long-standing commitment to human rights, democracy, and the rule of law, as well as its principled efforts to promote freedom, dignity, and justice both within Europe and globally.
Despite repeated international condemnations, Iranian authorities continue to use executions as a tool of political repression, targeting protesters, political dissidents, and vulnerable groups through unfair trials, forced confessions, and denial of due process. These practices constitute clear and serious violations of international human rights law.

I respectfully urge the European Union to continue prioritising human rights in its foreign policy and to strengthen support for international accountability mechanisms aimed at holding perpetrators of serious violations responsible. This includes targeted sanctions, diplomatic pressure, and active engagement with international human rights bodies.
The European Union’s moral authority and diplomatic influence can play a crucial role in protecting lives and promoting justice. Strong and sustained action sends a clear message that such crimes will not be tolerated by the international community.

I sincerely hope that the European Union will continue to stand firmly with the people of Iran in their pursuit of freedom, dignity, and fundamental human rights.

Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter.

Yours faithfully,
`,
